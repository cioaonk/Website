      2023- What a year. As I look back at all this last year contained, one persistent theme comes to mind. 
      2023 was a year of incredible grouwth and progress for me in a number of ways. Graduating college, moving across the country and starting full time in a new job will also do that.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Here are the biggest highlights for me personally, in no order:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> Earned CYSA+ by Comptia</li>

      <li> Completed my term as BYU Cybersecurity Student Association President </li>
      <li> Moved out to Washington DC </li>
      <li> Volunteered with CAMLIS </li>

    <br>

      <li> Showing up is such an important skill. </li>
      <li> You can both hit the ground running, and get your feet set under you after making a major change</li>

    <p> Overall I'm just grateful for how smooth, such a big transition this year has been. 
      The number of unexpected opportunities that have come my way and led me to even greater experiences than I could have expected.
      I can truly say this year was one of the most I've grown, learned, and enjoyed. If you've been a part of this, thank you- from the bottom of my heart.
