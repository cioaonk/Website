    <p>Recently, I received an intriguing email, which initially sparked skepticismâ€” was I being phished?</p>
    <img src="../imgs/email-redacted.png">
    <p> This led me to wonder how my email was discovered and whether the concern was genuine. I composed a brief, yet inquisitive reply. 
      A few hours later, I received a follow-up email, enriching the narrative with a company name and more context. 
    </p>
    <h2>Hacking? Reading The Situation</h2>
        <p> 
          Given plenty of information about the challenge at hand, I shifted my focus towards evaluating if my skills aligned with the presented issue and how I might address it.
           It quickly became evident that the challenge was less technical and more about effective communication. 
          The company was looking for someone with a security-focused mindset and a risk-aware perspective to alleviate their worries- and quickly. 
          Despite not having decades of experience, I felt sufficiently confident in my abilities to proceed to the next steps.</p>

    <h2>Crash Course in Becoming a Cybersecurity Consultant</h2>
        <p> Engaging with the client via video call, I realized the importance of presenting a professional demeanor.
           Despite the nagging feeling of impostor syndrome due to my lack of formal consulting experience,
            I recognized the value of my role as the "tech guy" within my family and my informal advisory position in friends' early-stage startups. 
            I've been "consulting" informally for years, but that is still well earned experience in approaching a problem, applying my knowledge and perspective to arrive at the best solution. 
            After consulting a couple people who do freelance and consult much more frequently about logistical and legal aspects, 
            I outlined the engagement terms in a concise two-page statement of work- which resembled the terms of engagement a Pentester would use in their engagements. 
           While its legal bindingness was uncertain, it helped reassure me in the regards that I was acting ethically to the best of my ability.  
        </p>

    <h2>Outcome & Reflections </h2>
        <p> Well unfortunately, this isn't the ending you're expecting. But I would say it definitely is a happy one. 
          The client preferred on-site assistance, which was logistically challenging due to my location across the country.
          However, I was able to connect them with a local colleague that I felt would do just as good of a job, if not better. 
          I completely understand their reasoning and from what I've heard after the fact, it went really well. 
          That being said, I still feel like this was a win in my book for a number of reasons. 
          I grew my understanding and perspective on what cybersecurity consulting at the small and medium business level could look like.
          Although I know opportunities of people randomly emailing my old college email account won't come frequently enough for me to start a business and quit my day job, it's definitely piqued my interest in consulting 
          to some extent. I made a new connection both professionally and strengthened the bond with the peer that ultimately completed the work.  
        </p>
    <h2> Key Insights:</h2>
    <p>
      As someone who values learning from experiences, here are my primary takeaways:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Cybersecurity Literacy:</b> There's a great and urgent need for cybersecurity literacy among small and medium-sized businesses.</li>
      <li><b>Random Emails:</b> Sometimes it is a phishing email, but sometimes it's a hastily written email by a operations employee who's looking for answers and a peace of mind during a stressful challenge.</li>
      <li><b> Our Potential and Responsibility to do good:</b> Cybersecurity is a field of never-ending problems and I love that challenge. Let's go out of our way to make the world and internet a better, safer place for all.</li>
    </ol>
    <p> If you would like to hire me as a cybersecurity consultant, I would be more than happy to jump on a short 30 minute video call to discuss!
